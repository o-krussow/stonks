## Main Ideas
We are looking for strategies, not stocks (to an extent)

Figure out when gains are realized for tax purposes

Use google trends

Consider weekends in trading, big spikes happen a lot here it seems

## Lets say we have a stock ticker, determine name of company from the stock ticker
- Now check google trends for the name of the company as the key word
- Check news page on google and find which words pop up a lot, use beautiful soup to scrape
- It would be nice if somehow we could determine positive or negative sentiment from this result

## Strategies:
- Find stock that follows some index fund roughly, and if stock does not follow index fund when index fund goes up, buy because it probably will. (Same idea if going down)

- Find best "sell level" (or % up) per stock based on back testing, figure out same for downwards trends, determine where to cut losses.
